## Running the Project Locally

The setup script will ensure you have Node.js and npm installed via Homebrew and will then install all necessary dependencies (including React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCss) and start the development server.

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/junocchi/htma-mapper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd htma-mapper
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
    ./setup.sh
   ```
